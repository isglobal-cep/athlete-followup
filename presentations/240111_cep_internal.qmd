## Selection bias

- From the subjects belonging to the HELIX sub-cohort (0th follow-up), only a fraction took part to the follow-up (1st follow-up).
- That is, among the eligible subjects, some are going to be excluded from our analyses since they have e.g., no outcome.
- Censoring from the analysis those with missing values might introduce **selection bias**.

## A simple example {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Suppose exposure `A` is a measure of SEP and outcome `Y` is diagnosis of ADHD. The censoring variable `C` is a collider on this pathway, and `L` is a confounder. To estimate the effect of `A` on `Y` we should NOT adjust for `C` (@fig-dag-bias).

  Y ~ A + L,
  A ~ L,
  exposure = "A",
  outcome = "Y",
  coords = list(
    x = c(A = 0, Y = 1, C = 0.5, L = 0.5),
    y = c(A = 0, Y = 0, C = 0.5, L = -0.5)
  )

## A simple example

- The problem is that in the 1st follow-up, we are implicitly adjusting for `C` as well, thus opening another path.
- Thus, censoring due to loss to follow-up can introduce selection bias. Generally, we are interested then in estimating an effect if nobody had been censored. If `A` is binary, we are interested in:

  $$E\left[Y ^ {a=1,c=0}\right] - E\left[Y ^ {a=0,c=0}\right],$$

  which is the joint effect of `A` and `C`.

## Reducing the effects of selection bias {.smaller}

- **IP weights** can be used to estimate [^1] our causal effect (to estimate the parameters of the MSM $E\left[Y^{a,c=0}\right] = \beta_0 + \beta_1a$):

  $$W ^ {A,C} = W^A \times W^C,$$
  
  with $W^C = 1 / Pr\left[C=0|L,A\right]$ ($W^C=0$ for the censored), and $W^A$ being the weights to adjust for confounding ($f(A|L)$).

- Alternatively, we can compute the *stabilized* IP weights:
  
  $$SW^C = Pr\left[C=0|A\right] / Pr\left[C=0|L,A\right].$$

- Alternatively, we can use standardization (outcome modeling) to adjust for confounding and selection bias.


[^1]: Under the identifiability conditions for the joint treatment $(A,C)$ conditional on $L$.

## An actual example {.smaller}

- *Reweighting the UK Biobank to reflect its underlying sampling population substantially reduces pervasive selection bias due to volunteering* [@van2022reweighting].
- UKB is not representative of the underlying sampling population. That is, among all the subjects eligible, most did not take part (*volunteer bias*).
- The authors modeled the selection process to correct for such biases using inverse probability weights, with data from the UK census [^2].

[^2]: I guess the same could be done for the HELIX cohort in pregnancy.

## The `SelectionWeights` R package {.smaller}

- Since weight estimation depends on question-specific confounders and eventually exposures, it makes sense for the researcher to estimate them directly.
- The aim (work in progress) is to create a R package ([`SelectionWeights`](https://github.com/isglobal-cep/SelectionWeights)) for that:

``` {r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

sel_weights <- SelectionWeights::estimate_selection_weights(
  dat = dat,
  id_str = "HelixID",
  ids_not_censored = ids_not_censored,
  formula = "sex + age + SEP",
  method_estimation = "glm",
  link_function = "gaussian",
  stabilized = TRUE,
  winsorization = 0.9,
  estimate_by = "cohort",
  sampling_weights = NULL,
  moments = NULL,
  interactions = NULL,
  library_sl = NULL,
  cv_control_sl = NULL,
  discrete_sl = NULL
)

mod <- glm(
  outcome ~ exposure + sex + age + SEP,
  data = dat,
  weights = sel_weights
)
```

## Exploring balance {.nostretch .smaller}

- Whether the estimated weights are actually *working*, can be determined with *tools* like the Love plot.

![Love plot](artwork/love_plot_example.png){width=500}

- Another element to take into account is the effective sample size after weighting.

## What's next?

- Finish the R package, including option to export the results in a nice format (e.g., `docx` tables for your papers).
- Add a vignette to explain what it does and how to use it.
- Add some unit tests to assess code correctness.
